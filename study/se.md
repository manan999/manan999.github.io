SOFTWARE CRISIS
---------------
The inability of IT professionals to develope bug-free software is known as <ins><strong>
Software Crisis </strong></ins>. Sadly, "Software Crisis" is something, the IT industry faces 
everyday. <br>
In the past, some Crisis have a caused a huge economical impact and have also resulted in the 
deaths of many humans. For example -

<ol>
	<li> <ins><strong>Y2k Problem :</strong></ins> This was the most crucial problem of
		the last century and it was simply our ignorance. It stems from our practice of
		using only the last 2 digits of an year. Thus, 4-digit format like 1964 would be 
		shortened to 64. Similar thing, couldn't be done with year 2000 as date cant be 00.
		Thus, millions of dollars had to be spent on fixing a practically non-existant 
		problem</li> <br>
	<li> <ins><strong>Star Wars Program :</strong></ins> This program was for the US "Patriot 
		Missiles". They were supposed to target and destroy Iraqi Squd missiles. However, it 
		failed several times and 28 soldiers died. The review team found a software bug in the
		system clock of missiles.</li> <br>
	<li> <ins><strong>Araine-5 Space Rocket :</strong></ins> This rocket was developed with a
		cost of $7 Billion over 10 years. However, it was destroyed within 39 seconds of its 
		launch. It also destroyed 4 scientific satellites. It was caused by computer's own 
		guidance system, which tried to convert rocket's sideways velocity from 64-bit to 16-bit.
		But, the value was too large and caused an overflow error and crashed the rocket.</li> <br>
	<li> <ins><strong>Windows XP :</strong></ins> Microsoft released Windows XP on 25/10/2001 
		and on the same day company had to post 18 MB of patches for bug fixes, enhancements and
		compatibility. 2 patches for fixing critical security holes, out of which 1 patch failed.
		Microsoft still advises its users to take backup for crucial data before installing 
		patches.</li> <br>
</ol>

What is Software Engineering
----------------------------

It is a science whose aim is the production of quality software that is delivered on time, within
budget and that satisfies its requirements.<br>
Software has become an important part of all human industries, but their are some serious problems
regarding the cost, timeliness, maintainence ad quality of software products. <br>
<b><ins>Software Engineering</ins></b> aims to solve all these problems by producing a quality, 
maintainable software on time and within budget.

____

Software Process
---------------
The way in which we produce software is called <b><ins>Software Process.</ins></b>
<ol>
	<li> Varies from organisation to organisation </li>
	<li> Requires hiring smart & knowledgeable developers and buying the latest 
		developement tools. </li>
	<li> Should be effective so that developers can use the best technical practices
		 to successfully make a software. </li>
</ol>

Difficulties in improving Software Process
------------------------------------------

<ol> 
	<li> <b><ins> Lack of Time: </ins></b> There is always a shortage of time. Developement
		schedules are unrealistic and leave very less time to do anything other than coding.
		Customers demand more softwares, with high quality in the least amount of time. </li>
	<br>
	<li> <b><ins> Lack of Knowledge: </ins></b> Most organisations don't even know the best 
		practices in the industry to develope software. Developers only read about coding and
		not about testing or quality. </li> <br>
	<li> <b><ins> Wrong Motivations: </ins></b> Many developers fail to understand the benefit 
		of a clear developement process and simply try to evade it. They are not motivated about
		meeting their commitments, improving customer satisfaction and delivering excellent 
	products. </li> <br>
	<li> <b><ins> Insufficient Commitment: </ins></b> Many times, the software process improvement
		fails, simply due to lack of commitment. This is because people fail to follow the actual
		changes. Even the management has no expectation from developers about this. There is no
	clear plan. Thus, no process improvement. </li> <br>
</ol>

Software Characteristics
------------------------

**Some important characteristics of a software:**

<ul>
	<li> <b><ins> No Lifetime: </ins></b> As we know, that hardware products wear out with time
		and their probability of failure increases. However, a software does not wear out with
		time. Software can become obsolete, but that is due to change in environment only.
	</li> <br>
	<li> <b><ins> Easy to Manufacture: </ins></b> Software developement is a one-time effort
		and continous maintainence. It is not hard to make 1000 copies of a software. Unlike
	hardware, it does not take raw material and cost for each single unit </li> <br>
	<li> <b><ins> Reusable Components: </ins></b> We can design standard components which 
		can be reused in various projects so we dont have to write everything from scratch.
		</li><br>
	<li> <b><ins> Flexible: </ins></b> A software can be made to do almost anything. However, 
		this "almost anything" make software difficult to plan and control. But, softwares
	can accomodate almost any kind of change. </li><br>
</ul>
