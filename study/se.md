SOFTWARE CRISIS
---------------
The inability of IT professionals to develope bug-free software is known as <ins><strong>
Software Crisis </strong></ins>. Sadly, "Software Crisis" is something, the IT industry faces 
everyday. <br>
In the past, some Crisis have a caused a huge economical impact and have also resulted in the 
deaths of many humans. For example -

<ol>
	<li> <ins><strong>Y2k Problem :</strong></ins> This was the most crucial problem of
		the last century and it was simply our ignorance. It stems from our practice of
		using only the last 2 digits of an year. Thus, 4-digit format like 1964 would be 
		shortened to 64. Similar thing, couldn't be done with year 2000 as date cant be 00.
		Thus, millions of dollars had to be spent on fixing a practically non-existant 
		problem</li> <br>
	<li> <ins><strong>Star Wars Program :</strong></ins> This program was for the US "Patriot 
		Missiles". They were supposed to target and destroy Iraqi Squd missiles. However, it 
		failed several times and 28 soldiers died. The review team found a software bug in the
		system clock of missiles.</li> <br>
	<li> <ins><strong>Araine-5 Space Rocket :</strong></ins> This rocket was developed with a
		cost of $7 Billion over 10 years. However, it was destroyed within 39 seconds of its 
		launch. It also destroyed 4 scientific satellites. It was caused by computer's own 
		guidance system, which tried to convert rocket's sideways velocity from 64-bit to 16-bit.
		But, the value was too large and caused an overflow error and crashed the rocket.</li> <br>
	<li> <ins><strong>Windows XP :</strong></ins> Microsoft released Windows XP on 25/10/2001 
		and on the same day company had to post 18 MB of patches for bug fixes, enhancements and
		compatibility. 2 patches for fixing critical security holes, out of which 1 patch failed.
		Microsoft still advises its users to take backup for crucial data before installing 
		patches.</li> <br>
</ol>
