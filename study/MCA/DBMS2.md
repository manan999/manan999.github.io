Entity
------

- An entity is any real-world object(can be both living or non-living), which has some attributes that give them an identity. e.g- School, Teacher, Employee, User, Book

Attributes
----------

- They represent the properties of an Entity. <br/>For e.g- Student can have Name, Age, Gender, Class, Section, etc. These are all called attributes
- Attributes must have fixed set or range of values that can be assigned to it. <br/>For example- Class attribute for student can only have values 1-12, Gender can only have 'M' or 'F'
- Attributes should also have constraints over them to make them more robust and reliable. <br/>For example- Name of a person cannot contain numeric values.
